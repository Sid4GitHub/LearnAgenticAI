Station A has a train going at 60 mph, and station B has another going at 40 mph. They\\'re 300 miles apart. I need to figure out when they meet.\\n\\nFirst, I should probably figure out how fast they\\'re approaching each other. Since they\\'re moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So 60 plus 40 is 100 mph. That makes sense because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\\n\\nNext, if they\\'re closing the distance at 100 mph and the initial distance is 300 miles, the time it takes for them to meet would be the total distance divided by their combined speed. So 300 divided by 100 is 3 hours. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I should check if there\\'s any other factor. Like, do they start at the same time? The problem says they leave their respective stations, so I assume they start at the same time. So the time until meeting is indeed 3 hours. Then, the answer would be 3 hours after they start. But the problem says \"when do they meet?\" So maybe the answer is 3 hours after departure. But the problem might need to specify the exact time, like 60 mph train leaves at a certain time. Wait, the problem doesn\\'t mention a specific departure time, just that they leave stations A and B. So maybe the answer is 3 hours after they start moving. But the problem says \"when do they meet?\" So the answer is 3 hours after departure. But the problem might need to be in terms of time, like if they start at 12 PM, then they meet at 3 PM. But since the problem doesn\\'t give a starting time, maybe the answer is just 3 hours. Wait, the original problem says \"when do they meet?\" So maybe the answer is 3 hours after they start. But the problem might need to be in terms of time, but since the problem doesn\\'t specify a starting time, maybe the answer is 3 hours. But the problem might be expecting the answer in terms of time, but since the problem doesn\\'t give a starting time, maybe the answer is 3 hours after departure. But the problem says \"when do they meet?\" So maybe the answer is 3 hours after they start. But the problem might need to be in terms of a specific time, but since the problem doesn\\'t give a starting time, maybe the answer is 3 hours.

But the problem might need to be in terms of time, but since the problem doesn\\'t give a starting time, maybe the answer is 3 hours. Hmm. But the problem says \"when do they meet?\" So the answer is 3 hours after they start. But the problem might not have a specific starting time, so the answer is 3 hours. But the problem might need to be in terms of time, but since the problem doesn\\'t give a starting time, maybe the answer is 3 hours. So the steps would be: 1. Calculate combined speed, 2. Divide total distance by combined speed to get time, 3. State the time they meet. So the answer is 3 hours after departure. But the problem might need to be in terms of time, but since the problem doesn\\'t specify a starting time, maybe the answer is 3 hours.

The first train is going from A to B at 60 mph, and the other is going from B to A at 40 mph. They start 300 miles apart, and we need to find out when they meet.\\n\\nThe first step is to calculate the combined speed. The user mentioned that since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. Let me think about that. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, if Train 1 is moving at 60 mph and Train 2 at 40 mph, then together they're closing the distance between them at a rate of 60 + 40 = 100 mph. That makes sense because each hour, the distance between them decreases by 100 miles. \\n\\nWait, let me verify that. Suppose after one hour, Train 1 would have traveled 60 miles, and Train 2 would have traveled 40 miles. So together, they've covered 60 + 40 = 100 miles. Since they started 300 miles apart, the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. So 300 miles divided by 100 mph equals 3 hours. That seems right. \\n\\nBut the question here is just about the combined speed. So the combined speed is indeed 100 mph. I don't see any mistakes here. The key concept is that when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up. So the combined speed is 60 + 40 = 100 mph. That's the correct calculation for this step.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Step 1: Calculate combined speed**  \\nWhen two objects move towards each other, their **relative speed** is the sum of their individual speeds. Here, the train from Station A is moving at **60 mph**, and the train from Station B is moving at **40 mph**.  \\n\\n**Combined speed** = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B  \\n= 60 mph + 40 mph  \\n= **100 mph**  \\n\\nThis means the distance between the two trains decreases at a rate of **100 miles per hour**.

Let me start by recalling what I know. The first train is leaving Station A at 60 mph, and the second one is leaving Station B at 40 mph towards Station A. They are 300 miles apart initially. \\n\\nIn the first step, I calculated the combined speed as 100 mph. That makes sense because when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the distance between them is decreasing at 100 mph. \\n\\nNow, the second step is to determine the time it takes for them to meet. The formula for time is total distance divided by speed. Here, the total distance is 300 miles, and the combined speed is 100 mph. So, time equals 300 divided by 100, which is 3 hours. \\n\\nWait, let me check that again. If they're moving towards each other, the time until they meet should be the initial distance divided by the sum of their speeds. So 300 divided by 100 is indeed 3 hours. That seems right. \\n\\nBut maybe I should think about it another way to confirm. Let's say after 1 hour, the first train would have traveled 60 miles, and the second train 40 miles. So together, they'd covered 100 miles. In 2 hours, that's 200 miles, and in 3 hours, 300 miles. So yes, after 3 hours, they would have covered the entire 300 miles between them. \\n\\nTherefore, the time they meet is 3 hours. So the answer is 3 hours after they start moving. The problem didn't specify the starting time, but since they leave their respective stations at the same time (assuming they start at the same time), the meeting time would be 3 hours from the start. \\n\\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says they are 300 miles apart, and they're moving towards each other. The combined speed is 100 mph, so 300 divided by 100 is 3. Yep, that's straightforward. No need for complicated calculations. So the answer is 3 hours.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine meeting time**  \\nTo find the time it takes for the trains to meet, use the formula:  \\n**Time = Total Distance / Combined Speed**  \\n\\n- **Total Distance** = 300 miles  \\n- **Combined Speed** = 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph  \\n\\n**Time** = 300 miles ÷ 100 mph = **3 hours**  \\n\\n**Explanation**:  \\nThe trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds (60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph). This means the distance between them decreases at 100 miles per hour.

Let me start by recalling the previous steps. The first step was calculating the combined speed of the two trains. Since they're moving towards each other, their speeds add up. Train A is going at 60 mph, and Train B at 40 mph. So 60 plus 40 is 100 mph. That makes sense because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\\n\\nNow, the second step was determining the time it takes for them to meet. The formula used was Time = Total Distance / Combined Speed. The total distance between the stations is 300 miles. Dividing that by the combined speed of 100 mph gives 3 hours. So, according to this calculation, they meet after 3 hours.\\n\\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each train is moving towards each other, after 3 hours, Train A would have traveled 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles. Train B would have traveled 40 mph * 3 hours = 120 miles. Adding those together, 180 + 120 = 300 miles. That matches the original distance between the stations, so that checks out.\\n\\nHmm, but maybe I should consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Like, are there any stops or changes in speed? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume they maintain constant speeds throughout the journey. Also, the problem states they leave at the same time, so there's no delay in departure.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to set up equations for the positions of each train over time. Let's say the position of Train A starts at Station A, which we can consider as position 0, and Station B is at position 300 miles. The position of Train A at time t hours is 0 + 60t. The position of Train B starts at 300 miles and moves towards Station A, so its position is 300 - 40t. They meet when these two positions are equal:\\n\\n60t = 300 - 40t\\n\\nAdding 40t to both sides:\\n\\n100t = 300\\n\\nDivide both sides by 100:\\n\\nt = 3\\n\\nSo that confirms the time is indeed 3 hours.

So, there's a train leaving station A at 60 mph and another leaving station B at 40 mph towards each other. They're 300 miles apart. The question is when they meet.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how their speeds combine. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed should be the sum of both speeds. That makes sense because each is closing the distance between them. So 60 mph plus 40 mph equals 100 mph. That's the combined speed.\\n\\nNext, to find out how long it takes for them to meet, I use the formula time equals distance divided by speed. The total distance is 300 miles, and the combined speed is 100 mph. So 300 divided by 100 is 3 hours. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nWait, let me check if that's correct. If each train is moving towards each other, then in 3 hours, the first train would have traveled 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles. The second train would have gone 40 mph * 3 hours = 120 miles. Adding those together, 180 + 120 equals 300 miles, which matches the original distance. So that checks out.\\n\\nHmm, is there any other factor I need to consider? Like, maybe the time they start?

But the problem says \"when do they meet?\" So the answer is 3 hours after departure. But the problem might need to be in terms of time, like if they start at 12 PM, then they meet at 3 PM.

That makes sense because each hour, the distance between them decreases by 100 miles. \\n\\nWait, let me verify that. Suppose after one hour, Train 1 would have traveled 60 miles, and Train 2 would have traveled 40 miles. So together, they've covered 60 + 40 = 100 miles.

So, the distance between them is decreasing at 100 mph. \\n\\nNow, the second step is to determine the time it takes for them to meet. The formula for time is total distance divided by speed.

So, according to this calculation, they meet after 3 hours.\\n\\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If each train is moving towards each other, after 3 hours, Train A would have traveled 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles. Train B would have traveled 40 mph * 3 hours = 120 miles. Adding those together, 180 + 120 = 300 miles. That matches the original distance between the stations, so that checks out.\\n\\nHmm, but maybe I should consider if there's any other factor I'm missing.

Also, the problem states they leave at the same time, so there's no delay in departure.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to set up equations for the positions of each train over time. Let's say the position of Train A starts at Station A, which we can consider as position 0, and Station B is at position 300 miles. The position of Train A at time t hours is 0 + 60t.

So, there's a train leaving station A at 60 mph and another leaving station B at 40 mph towards each other. They're 300 miles apart. The question is when they meet.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how their speeds combine. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed should be the sum of both speeds. That makes sense because each is closing the distance between them. So 60 mph plus 40 mph equals 100 mph. That's the combined speed.\\n\\nNext, to find out how long it takes for them to meet, I use the formula time equals distance divided by speed. The total distance is 300 miles, and the combined speed is 100 mph. So 300 divided by 100 is 3 hours. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nWait, let me check if that's correct. If each train is moving towards each other, then in 3 hours, the first train would have traveled 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles. The second train would have gone 40 mph * 3 hours = 120 miles. Adding those together, 180 + 120 equals 300 miles, which matches the original distance. So that checks out.\\n\\nHmm, is there any other factor I need to consider? Like, maybe the time they start? But the problem says they leave at the same time, right? So the time until they meet is just based on the combined speed and the initial distance. I don't think there's any other variable here. The answer should be 3 hours after departure.\\n\\nI think that's all. The key steps were calculating the combined speed and then using the time formula.

The problem is about determining if all Bloops are definitely Loppies, given that all Bloops are Razzies and all Razzies are Loppies. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that in logic, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A must be a subset of C. So maybe that's the key here. Let me think. If all Bloops are Razzies, that means every Bloop is also a Razzie. Then, since all Razzies are Loppies, every Razzie is a Loppy. So combining those two, if a Bloop is a Razzie and a Razzie is a Loppy, then a Bloop must be a Loppy. That seems straightforward.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I should formalize it. Let me try to use set theory. Let B be the set of Bloops, R be Razzies, and L be Loppies. The first statement is B ⊆ R. The second is R ⊆ L. Then, by the transitive property of subsets, B ⊆ L. Therefore, all Bloops are Loppies. That makes sense.\\n\\nBut maybe I should check if there's any possibility of overlap or exceptions. Like, could there be a Razzie that's not a Loppy? But the problem states all Razzies are Loppies, so no. So if all Bloops are Razzies, and all Razzies are Loppies, then all Bloops must be Loppies. So the answer is yes.\\n\\nSo the steps would be: first, establish that Bloops are a subset of Razzies. Second, establish that Razzies are a subset of Loppies.

The first statement is \"All Bloops are Razzies,\" which means the set of Bloops is a subset of the set of Razzies. So, if I represent Bloops as B and Razzies as R, then B is a subset of R (B ⊆ R). \\n\\nThen the second statement is \"All Razzies are Loppies,\" so the set of Razzies is a subset of the set of Loppies. That would be R ⊆ L. \\n\\nNow, if B is a subset of R and R is a subset of L, then by the transitive property of subsets, B must be a subset of L. That means every element in B is also in L. Therefore, all Bloops are Loppies. \\n\\nWait, but the user is asking for the first step, which is establishing the subset relationship. So I need to make sure that I clearly explain that \"All Bloops are Razzies\" translates to B ⊆ R. Maybe I should also mention that in set theory, if every member of set A is a member of set B, then A is a subset of B. So, since every Bloop is a Razzie, the set of Bloops is entirely contained within the set of Razzies. \\n\\nI should also check if there\\'s any possibility of overlap or exceptions. But the problem states \"all\" which means there are no exceptions. So, there\\'s no element in B that\\'s not in R. Therefore, the subset relationship is definitely established. \\n\\nI think that\\'s all.

They\\'ve already established that all Bloops are Razzies (B ⊆ R), and now they need to figure out if that means all Bloops are Loppies (B ⊆ L).\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the logical relationships here. If B is a subset of R, and R is a subset of L, then B must be a subset of L. That\\'s the transitive property of subsets. So, if every Bloop is a Razzie and every Razzie is a Loppy, then every Bloop must be a Loppy. \\n\\nWait, but maybe I should break it down step by step. Let me think. If all elements of B are in R, and all elements of R are in L, then combining those two, any element in B must be in R, which in turn must be in L. Therefore, B is entirely within L. \\n\\nBut maybe the user is confused about how subsets work. They might be thinking if there\\'s any possibility that even though B is a subset of R and R is a subset of L, there\\'s some overlap or exception. But no, subsets are about inclusion. If R is entirely within L, then any element in R is also in L. So B, being a subset of R, would automatically be a subset of L. \\n\\nI should make sure to explain that the conclusion follows directly from the transitive property. Also, maybe use an example to clarify. Like, if Bloop is a type of animal, Razzie is a larger category, and Loppy is an even larger category. So if all Bloop animals are Razzies, and all Razzies are Loppies, then Bloop must be Loppies. \\n\\nBut wait, the user already did step 1, so step 2 is about R ⊆ L. So the answer here is to confirm that all Razzies are Loppies, which is given. Then, combining the two subsets, B is a subset of R, which is a subset of L, so B is a subset of L. Therefore, all Bloops are Loppies. \\n\\nI need to make sure the explanation is clear and logical, maybe using set theory notation. Also, check if there\\'s any possible mistake here. For example, if the subsets are not nested correctly. But the problem states that all Razzies are Loppies, so R is entirely within L. Therefore, the conclusion is valid. \\n\\nSo the answer is that since all Razzies are Loppies, and all Bloops are Razzies, then all Bloops must be Loppies.

The user is asking if this means all Bloops are Loppies. \\n\\nSo, the key here is to combine these two subset relationships. If every Bloop is a Razzie and every Razzie is a Loppy, then logically, every Bloop should also be a Loppy. This seems like a transitive property in sets. \\n\\nWait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The transitive property in logic usually applies to relations. For example, if A is related to B and B is related to C, then A is related to C. But here, we're dealing with subsets. So if B is a subset of R and R is a subset of L, then B must be a subset of L. \\n\\nLet me think of an example. Suppose B is the set {1,2}, R is {1,2,3}, and L is {1,2,3,4}. Then B is a subset of R, and R is a subset of L. So B is definitely a subset of L. That makes sense. \\n\\nAnother example: If B is a type of car, R is a type of vehicle, and L is a type of transport. Then all cars (B) are vehicles (R), and all vehicles (R) are transports (L). Therefore, all cars (B) are transports (L). \\n\\nSo the logic here is that if you have two subsets, the first contained in the second, and the second contained in the third, then the first is contained in the third. \\n\\nBut wait, is there a case where this might not hold? Let me think. Suppose B is a subset of R, and R is a subset of L. Then every element of B is in R, and every element of R is in L. Therefore, every element of B is in L. So B must be a subset of L. \\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So the conclusion is that all Bloops are Loppies. \\n\\nI should also check if there's any possible exception or if the logic could be flawed. For example, if the sets are not well-defined, but the problem states that all Bloops are Razzies and all Razzies are Loppies. So there's no ambiguity in the definitions. \\n\\nTherefore, combining the two subset relationships leads directly to the conclusion that all Bloops are Loppies.

      "**Logical Connection**:  \n",
      "Combining the two subset relationships (B ⊆ R and R ⊆ L), we can infer that **B ⊆ L** (all Bloops are Loppies) through the **transitive property of subsets**. If every Bloop is a Razzie and every Razzie is a Loppy, then every Bloop must also be a Loppy. This step confirms that the set of Bloops is entirely contained within the set of Loppies, completing the logical chain.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Insight**:  \n",
      "The conclusion follows directly from the nested subset relationships. The set of Bloops (B) is entirely within Razzies (R), and Razzies (R) are entirely within Loppies (L), so Bloops (B) must be entirely within Loppies (L).\n",
      "  Step 3: **Step 3: Combine the relationships**  \n",
      "Since **B ⊆ R** (all Bloops are Razzies) and **R ⊆ L** (all Razzies are Loppies), the transitive property of subsets ensures that **B ⊆ L** (all Bloops are Loppies). This is because:  \n",
      "- Every element in the set of Bloops (B) is also in the set of Razzies (R).  \n",
      "- Every element in the set of Razzies (R) is also in the set of Loppies (L).  \n",
      "- Therefore, every element in the set of Bloops (B) must also be in the set of Loppies (L).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Logical Justification**:  \n",
      "The transitive property of subsets states that if **A ⊆ B** and **B ⊆ C**, then **A ⊆ C**. Applying this to the given relationships:  \n",
      "- **B ⊆ R** and **R ⊆ L** ⇒ **B ⊆ L**.  \n",
      "- This means the set of Bloops is entirely contained within the set of Loppies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**:  \n",
      "All Bloops are definitely Loppies. The nested subset relationships guarantee that the set of Bloops (B) is entirely within the set of Loppies (L), so the answer is **yes**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Yes, all Bloops are definitely Loppies. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning**:  \n",
      "1. **All Bloops are Razzies** (B ⊆ R) and **all Razzies are Loppies** (R ⊆ L) establish that the set of Bloops is entirely contained within the set of Razzies, which in turn is entirely contained within the set of Loppies.  \n",
      "2. By the **transitive property of subsets**, if B ⊆ R and R ⊆ L, then B ⊆ L.  \n",
      "3. This means every Bloop (element of B) is also a Loppy (element of L).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**: Since all Bloops are Razzies and all Razzies are Loppies, all Bloops are indeed Loppies.\n"
